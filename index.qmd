## 2025 Field Season Report {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the 2025 IMBCR Annual Report! We hope you find it to be
user-friendly and informative. This report will help you access results
from IMBCR avian point count surveys, including species observations and
population estimates such as density, occupancy, and population trend.
This website contains all the same information we've presented in past
years' reports, but if you prefer a PDF version of the report, we can provide one.

#### **Navigating this document**

Use the sidebar on the left to navigate to different sections of the
report and search within the document. Within many sections, an "On this
page" menu of links will appear on the right. This menu may collapse
when content extends across the page, but you can click on the collapsed
label to access the navigation links.

#### **Quick start guide - viewing the results**

> ##### **Survey locations, species observations, density, occupancy, and population trend**
>
> Visit the brand-new [Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center
> 2.0](https://apps.birdconservancy.org/rmadc/) (RMADC)! Here
> you'll find interactive maps illustrating survey and detection
> locations, and tables displaying species counts and population
> estimates (i.e., density, occupancy, and population trend).
>
> Use the "Explore the Data" tab on the RMADC to filter data by
> geographic region, year, and species.
>
> To navigate the filters, it's helpful to use this report to
> determine the "Stratum" or "Superstratum" relevant to you. Click on
> the relevant agency or geographic region on the sidebar on the left
> side of this page, then use the "On this page" menu to choose a
> management unit. The relevant Stratum or Superstratum will be will be
> listed there.
>
> ##### **Need some help?**
>
> Please contact [Jennifer
> Timmer](mailto:%20jennifer.timmer@birdconservancy.org) if you have any
> questions about accessing or interpreting IMBCR results.

Please note that not every stratum or conceivable combination of strata
is summarized in this report. However, all individual strata and all
biologically meaningful combinations of strata, or “superstrata”, can be
found on the RMADC.

Instructions for using the RMADC are included in Appendix A of this
report.

## Special Feature - Conservation & Management

In @sec-feature we highlight two examples of IMBCR trends for managers and decision-makers to monitor both priority species of concern and common species in decline by accessing data via our new Rocky Mountain Avian Data Center.
